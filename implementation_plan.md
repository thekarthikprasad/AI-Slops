# Convert to APK using Capacitor
## Goal Description
Convert the existing React Vite expense manager web app into a native Android APK so it can be installed on Android devices.

## Proposed Changes
### Capacitor Integration
- [NEW] capacitor-config.md (Capacitor config file)
- [MODIFY] package.json (add capacitor scripts and dependencies)
- [NEW] android/ (Android project generated by Capacitor)
- [NEW] src-capacitor/ (optional folder for native code)

### Build Process
- Add a production build script (`npm run build`) that outputs to `dist`.
- Use `npx cap add android` to generate Android platform.
- Run `npx cap sync android` to copy web assets.
- Open Android Studio (`npx cap open android`) and build the APK.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Steps
- Run `npm run build` to ensure the web app builds successfully.
- Execute `npx cap add android` and `npx cap sync android`.
- Verify that `android/app/src/main/assets/public` contains the built files.

### Manual Steps
- Open Android Studio, build a release APK, and test installation on a device.
- Verify UI works, especially the rupee symbol and theme.
